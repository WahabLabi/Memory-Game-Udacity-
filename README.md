- The game consists of a grid of 16 cards: there are eight pairs and your aim is to match each pair
- The cards are shuffled and then distributed, face-down, on the grid
- Click on two cards at a time to reveal their symbols:
  - If they match then they'll turn green and stay revealed
  - If they don't then they'll flash red and then go blank again
- There's a star rating based on how many moves you take to complete the game:
  - Three stars (less than 32 moves)
  - Two stars (32 - 47 moves) 
  - One star (48 or more moves)
- At the end of the game there'll be popup with a summary of your performance

## Development

This was one of my projects for my [Front End Developer Nanodegree][2] at [Udacity][3]. The aim of the project was for students to use their HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills to build a complex application - you can see some of my code in the [app.js](js/app.js) file in this repository.

Skills developed:

* [x] Development strategy: breaking down and planning a project
