- The game consists of eight pairs of cards and your aim is to match each pair
- The cards are shuffled and then distributed around the deck
- Click on two cards to reveal their symbols:
  - If they match then they will turn green and stay revealed
  - If they don't match then they will flash red and then go blank again
- There's a star rating based on how many moves you take to complete the game:
  - Three stars (less than 32 moves)
  - Two stars (32 - 47 moves) 
  - One star (48 or more moves)
- At the end of the game there'll be popup with a summary of your performance

## Access and Installation

You can play the game by [clicking here][1] or by cloning/downloading this repository and then opening the index.html file

## Development

This game was one of my projects for my [Front End Developer Nanodegree][2] at [Udacity][3]. Udacity provided the game engine and resources and then I used my object-oriented JavaScript (OOJS) skills to make it work perfectly - you can see some of my code in the [app.js](js/app.js) file in this repository.

Skills developed:

* [x] OOJS
* [x] ES6 (especially the use of classes)
* [x] DOM manipulation
* [x] CSS styling
* [x] Game development (especially 2D collision detection and keyboard control mechanisms)
