## Development

This game was built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript - you can see my JavaScript code in the [app.js](js/app.js) file. In particular I used and further refined the following skills during the development of this game:

* [x] Development strategy: breaking down and planning a project
* [x] Use of JavaScript arrays for data manipulation
* [x] Use of JavaScript timing events (setTimeout() and setInterval())
* [x] Use of functions (callback functions, arrow functions, IIFEs)
* [x] Creation and use of modals/popups
* [x] DOM manipulation:
  * [x] Listening for and then handling events
  * [x] Selecting and manipulating DOM elements
* [x] Use of Chrome DevTools
