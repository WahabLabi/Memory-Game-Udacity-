## Development

This was one of my projects for my [Front End Developer Nanodegree][2] at [Udacity][3]. The aim of the project was for students to use their HTML, CSS and JavaScript skills to build a complex application - you can see some of my code in the [app.js](js/app.js) file in this repository.

Skills developed:

* [x] Development strategy: breaking down and planning a project
* [x] Use of JavaScript arrays for data manipulation
* [x] Use of JavaScript timing events (setTimeout() and setInterval())
* [x] Use of Immediately Invoked Function Expressions
* [x] Creation and use of modals/popups
* [x] DOM manipulation:
  * [x] Listening for and then handling events
  * [x] Selecting and manipulating DOM elements
* [x] Debugging
